# University of the Cumberlands: A Data Comparison Project

# Introduction
I embarked on this project after noticing a Business Intelligence Analyst position at the University of the Cumberlands (UC), my alma mater. To demonstrate my analytical skills and enhance my resume, I chose to analyze and compare key statistics of UC with those of Georgetown College (GC), a comparable institution.

# Graduation Rates
Initially, I planned to focus solely on graduation rates. However, the substantial difference between UC's and GC's rates caught my attention. Georgetown College boasts significantly higher graduation rates compared to UC, highlighting a critical area for improvement at UC. It's likely the university is aware of this disparity and working towards addressing it.

# Enrollment
The next aspect I examined was enrollment numbers. UC has a significantly higher enrollment than GC. This discrepancy can be attributed to UC's extensive online education programs, which attract a larger student population, whereas GC primarily depends on in-person enrollment.

# Price
UC is reputed to be one of the most affordable colleges in Kentucky, and the data supports this claim. UC's tuition and fees are notably lower than those of GC, making it a more economical choice for many students.

# Conclusion
The data suggests that UC, despite its lower graduation rates, should ideally have comparable rates to GC given its higher enrollment and affordability. Several factors might explain this gap:

Online Enrollment Impact: UC's large online student body may include many who pursue certificates or other non-degree qualifications, affecting overall graduation rates.
Geographic Considerations: UC's location in southern Kentucky, near the Tennessee border, offers fewer local amenities and opportunities compared to GC's proximity to Lexington and Louisville, KY, potentially influencing student retention and success.

# Credits
The data for this analysis was sourced from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Detailed information and datasets for these schools and many others can be accessed at NCES IPEDS.
